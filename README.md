The code has the object to plot the streamlines of an electric field generated by 1 to N charges using numpy and matplotlib. 
This repository was initiated with the goal to study Python visualization and Electrostatics.

The `main.py` file has the functions that can be used to generate the graphics, and `example.py` has an example of the code working.
